### Ingredientes
 - 440g de farinha branca
 - 5g de sal
 - 5g de fermento seco
 - 50g de azeite de oliva
 - 375g de água morna


### Modo de preparo
Let it rest for about 15 minutes before giving it your first stretch and fold. Continue giving it 2 more stretches and folds every 15 minutes.

Once your stretch and folding is done, let it rise for about 1 – 2 hours or until it doubles in size.

Using a 9×13 inch baking tray, drizzle in some olive oil and spread it out in the pan. Make sure to oil up the sides and the corners.

Add in your focaccia dough and spread it out as best you can. Let it rest for about 15 minutes so the gluten structure in the dough can relax and you can stretch it to the full size of your pan.

Once you have stretched your dough out, give it another 15 minutes rest.

Next, drizzle more olive oil over your dough. Dot your dough with cut up sundried tomatoes, olives, and rosemary.

Using a salt brine, which is just 1/4 cup of warm or room temperature water with about 1 teaspoon of salt mixed in until dissolved, start dimpling your bread being sure to push some of your topping into your dough. Cover your dough and proof for about 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.

Once your dough has risen, preheat your oven to 215 degrees celsius and bake for 25 – 28 minutes.
